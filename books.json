And although 25 years have passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published, readers will find that very little in the book itself has changed \u2014 and for good reason. While so much in our world is changing a high speed, the lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad Poor Dad haven\u2019t changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role in our daily lives, the messages in Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s international bestseller are more timely and more important than ever.\r\n\r\nMilestones \r\n\r\nWhile there is a milestone  to commemorate \u2014 and a new section in the book on Why Milestones Are Important \u2014 preserving the integrity of the original content is testimony to the fact that this book has truly stood the test of time. The sidebars throughout the book (that were updated for the 20-year anniversary edition) have been updated again, but the core principles that parents and grandparents \u2014 those who embraced Robert\u2019s story and messages 25 years ago \u2014 are sharing them with new generations who have found that its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense lessons can be applied to anyone\u2019s life and their vision for a future that includes taking control of their finances.\r\nPeople of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones. We use them to measure time, mark progress, reflect on the lessons we\u2019ve learned, and celebrate accomplishments\u2026 and they give meaning to our life\u2019s journey.

Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius's life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk -- one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history -- is a contemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy. Thorough and insightful, Elon Musk brings to life a technology industry that is rapidly and dramatically changing by examining the life of one of its most powerful and influential titans. - Publisher.", "subjects": ["SpaceX (Firm)", "PayPal (Firm)", "Businesspeople", "Biography", "Tesla Motors", "Businesspeople, biography", "Technological innovations, economic aspects", "Aerospace industries", "Automobiles, electric", "Inventors", "nyt:combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction=2015-06-07", "New York Times bestseller", "New York Times reviewed", "Technological innovations", "Economic aspects", "Gens d'affaires", "Biographies", "Inventeurs", "Innovations", "Aspect \u00e9conomique", "Innovations technologiques", "Hommes d'affaires", "Aspects \u00e9conomiques", "SpaceX (Firme)", "PayPal (Firme)", "Technology, economic aspects", "Entrepreneurship", "Business, biography"], "pages": 448, "year": 2013, "isbn": "9780062469670", "key": "/works/OL17184556W", "status": null, "owned": false, "finishedAt": null, "notes": null}, "5": {"title": "Crush it!", "author": "Gary Vaynerchuk", "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Do you have a hobby you wish you could indulge in all day?
